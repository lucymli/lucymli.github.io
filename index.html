 <img src="https://github.com/lucymli/lucymli.github.io/raw/master/images/treepose.jpg" width="240px" height="300px", align="right"/> My research in infectious diseases is focused on understanding how pathogens spread. Although my academic roots are in the biological sciences, I have since developed skills in statistical analysis and programming to tackle interesting public health problems. I am an avid user of R, R markdown, and ggplot2, basically any tools that make reproducible research that much easier.

 Outside of working hours, I occupy myself with yoga, gym, and hiking.
