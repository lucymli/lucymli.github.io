    I am a recent transplant to Boston having lived in London for many years. Love the people, love the beer, could do without the snow. <br><br>
		My research in infectious diseases is focused on understanding how pathogens spread. Although my academic roots are in the biological sciences, I have since developed skills in statistical analysis and programming to tackle interesting public health problems. I am an avid user of R, R markdown, and ggplot2, basically any tools that make reproducible research that much easier.<br><br>
        Outside of working hours, I occupy myself with yoga, gym, and hiking.<br><br>
