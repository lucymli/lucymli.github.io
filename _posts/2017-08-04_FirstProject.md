title: Looking back at my first R script
---

Most of my days are spent sitting in front of a computer, debugging C++ code and writing new R functions. The 20 year old me would have never dreamt such a thing possible as I was hanging out with bacteria on petri dishes (although some things never change...). I have since picked up a wide range of mathematical, statistical, and programming skills, enabling me to become a more well-rounded infectious disease scientist. 

This is my first blog post, so I guess I'll start from the beginning with my first foray into the world of maths and computing. But before then, I'll explain why I decided to go down this route at all.

Final year of university. Those around me who did a summer internship in a non-academic company all received job offers for next year. After a summer in the wet lab, I was more uncertain than ever about what I wanted to do next. It was the first time that I had actually thought about my future career, instead of just blindly doing whatever was available and interesting. 

While I still found biology interesting, I could not see myself spending many years in a lab coat performing manual work in order to get a few data points. Perhaps due to external factors but probably mostly because of my clumsiness, repeating the same experiment never yielded the same results. With just one more year left in my degree, I felt disillusioned with biology/science and entirely lost about my future plans.
