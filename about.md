Having worked in academia, non-profit, and now industry, I want to bring together the innovative spirits across research and technology to improve public health. My main data science interest is in integrating multiple sources of data, particularly genomics + count data. Additionally, I want to operationize mathematical modeling to be used in an automated and scalable way to maximize impact.

## Interests

* Dynamic and stochastic models of infectious diseases
* Statistical inference/learning - how to infer unobserved quantities and predict future events
* Phylodynamics - using genetic data to understand how infectious diseases spread
* Electronic health records and automated mathematical modeling
* Mobility data + genomic data

## Positions

* Director of Infectious Disease Modeling at biotech startup [The Public Health Company](https://www.thepublichealthco.com/) (March 2021-present)

* Data scientist at non-profit biomedical research organization [Chan Zuckerberg Biohub](https://czbiohub.org), San Francisco (June 2018-March 2021)

* Postdoctoral research fellow at [Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics](http://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/About/Postdocs/Lucy-Li), Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (January 2017-June 2018)

## Education

* PhD in Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London, UK (2013-2017)
* Computational Biology MPhil with Distinction at University of Cambridge, UK (2012-2013)
* Biology BSc with First Class Honours at Imperial College London, UK (2009-2012)

## Life outside of science

Having lived in China, UK, and the USA, I have accumulated an amalgam of accents and interests.

* Treasurer of Postdoctoral Association at Harvard School of Public Health (2017-2018)
* President of Imperial College Yoga Club (2014-2015)
* Treasurer of Imperial College Badminton Club (2011-2012)
* Events Coordinator of Imperial College British Heart Foundation (2011-2012)
* Volunteer Mandarin Tutor with Imperial College Chinese Students and Scholars Association (2010-2011)
* Piano tutor (2009)
