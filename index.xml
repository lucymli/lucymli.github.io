      <description>I regularly hung out with bacteria on petri dishes during my undergraduate days. Since then, I have become good friends with all things Bayesian, played around with particle filters, and enthusiastically adopted R Markdown as my notetaking method of choice. I still hang out with pathogens, but only on screen and in the form of plushie toys. This is my first blog post, so I&amp;rsquo;ll start from the beginning with my first foray into the world of maths and computing (my first R scripts and my first computational project report).</description>
