      <description>I regularly hung out with bacteria on petri dishes during my undergraduate days. Since then, I have become good friends with all things Bayesian, played around with particle filters, and enthusiastically adopted R Markdown as my notetaking method of choice. I still hang out with pathogens, but only on screen and in the form of plushie toys. This is my first blog post, so I&amp;rsquo;ll start from the beginning with my first foray into the world of maths and computing (my first R scripts and my first computational project report).</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
