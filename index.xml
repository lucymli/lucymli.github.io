      <description>Having worked in academia, non-profit, and now industry, I want to bring together the innovative spirits across research and technology to improve public health. My main data science interest is in integrating multiple sources of data, particularly genomics + count data. Additionally, I want to operationize mathematical modeling to be used in an automated and scalable way to maximize impact.
Interests  Dynamic and stochastic models of infectious diseases Statistical inference/learning - how to infer unobserved quantities and predict future events Phylodynamics - using genetic data to understand how infectious diseases spread Electronic health records and automated mathematical modeling Mobility data + genomic data  Positions   Director of Infectious Disease Modeling at biotech startup The Public Health Company (March 2021-present)</description>

      <description>I regularly hung out with bacteria on petri dishes during my undergraduate days. Since then, I have become good friends with all things Bayesian, played around with particle filters, and enthusiastically adopted R Markdown as my notetaking method of choice. I still hang out with pathogens, but only on screen and in the form of plushie toys. This is my first blog post, so I&amp;rsquo;ll start from the beginning with my first foray into the world of maths and computing (my first R scripts and my first computational project report).</description>
